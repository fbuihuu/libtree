* Design

This is yet another implementation of some famous (balanced) binary
search trees. As of writing this, BST, AVL, Red-Black and Splay trees
are implemented.

Here's a list of the major points:

    - Nodes of the tree aims to be embedded inside your own
      structure. This removes the need to do some malloc/free during
      insertion/removal operations and saves some space since
      allocation infrastructure (such as object descriptors or
      object alignment) is not required.

      The idea is borrowed from the Linux kernel.

    - On most architectures (at least the ones I'm using), pointers
      have some unused bits which can be used to store node's
      meta-data. This allows to reduce the size of the node structure,
      and make them as small as possible on a vast majority of
      architectures.

      If the hardware you're working on doesn't allow such
      optimisation, the library still provides an implementation which
      is fully portable (C99), at the cost of an increasing node
      structure size.

      For now, the optimised (but non portable) version is used if
      'uintptr_t' is defined on your platform.

    - Traversals in both direction are efficient for all type of
      trees. When needed, some implementations use *threaded* trees
      making the traversal algorithm much simpler.

    - The trees don't store duplicate keys. It's fairly easy to
      implement duplicate from the user point of view (by having a
      list at the node for instance) and this allows to have a simple
      but efficient API (see below).

* API

You should never actually need to play with the internal members of
either tree or node structures.

Nodes are embedded inside your own structure, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  struct my_struct {
          int key;
          struct avltree_node node;
  };
#+END_SRC

A tree needs to be initialized before being used. For example, in
order to initialize an AVL tree:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  struct avltree tree;
  /* ... */
  avltree_init(&tree, cmp_fn, 0);
#+END_SRC

The user must provide a comparison function. This function will be
called by the library with two arguments that point to the node
structures embedded in the user structures being compared.

For instance, the user must provide a function whose prototype is:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  int my_cmp(const struct avltree_node *, const struct avltree_node *);
#+END_SRC

To be usefull, the user must be able to retrieve the pointers on his
two structures which embed the 2 nodes pointed by the 2
parameters. For that, the library provides a couple of helpers.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  bstree_container_of(node, type, member)
  rbtree_container_of(node, type, member)
  avltree_container_of(node, type, member)
  splaytree_container_of(node, type, member)
#+END_SRC

Below gives a definition of the comparison function:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  int my_cmp(const struct avltree_node *a, const struct avltree_node *b)
  {
          struct my_struct *p = avltree_container_of(a, my_struct, node);
          struct my_struct *q = avltree_container_of(b, my_struct, node);
  
          return p->key - q->key;
  }
#+END_SRC

A set of functions is provided to manipulate trees. All of them take
only pointers to tree and node structures. They have no idea about the
user's structures which contain them.

** Lookup

If you need to search for the node having a specific key then you need
to fill up a dummy structure with the key initialized to the value so
your compare function will successfully compare the passed dummy
structure with the ones inside the tree.

The lookup operation returns the node with the same key if inserted
previously otherwise NULL.

** Insertion

Trees don't store duplicate keys, since rotations don't preserve the
binary search tree property in this case. If the user needs to do so,
then he can keep a separate list of all records having the same key.

This is the reason why the insertion functions do insert a key only if
the key hasn't been already inserted. Otherwise it's equivalent to a
lookup operation and the insertion operation just returns the node
with the same key already inserted, and no insertion happened. At this
point the user can use a list and append the new node to the list
given by the returned node.

** Removal

For speed reasons, the remove operation assumes that the node was
already inserted into the tree.

Indeed tree implementations using parent pointers don't need to do any
lookups to retrieve the node's parent needed during the remove
operation.

Therefore you must use the remove operation with an already inserted
node.

** Replace

Since trees don't store duplicate keys, the library provides an
operation to replace a node with another one whose key is equal to the
replaced node.

This operation is faster than remove/insert operations for balanced
trees since it doesn't need to rebalance the tree.

** Traversal

The API allows you to walk through the tree in sorted order.

For that, you can retrieve the next or the previous of any inserted
nodes. You can also get the first (leftmost) and the last (rightmost)
node of a tree.

* Installation

The current Makefile has been tested only on Linux system.

To compile and install the library, just do:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ make
  $ make install
#+END_SRC

By default the library will be installed in '/usr/local/lib' directory.

As usual you change this path by passing 'prefix=' option.

You can also change the installation root directory by passing
'DESTDIR=' option.
